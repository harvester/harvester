# Upgrade Helpers

A collection of useful helpers for Harvester upgrades.

subcommands are listed below:

- vm-live-migrate-detector

## vm-live-migrate-detector

A simple command line tool that helps detect if the VMs on a specific node can be live-migrated to other nodes considering the following:

- Node selectors: If a VM is running on a specific node and has a node selector configured, the VM is considered non-live-migratable
- PCIe devices: If a VM has PCIe devices attached, it is considered non-live-migratable
- Node affinities: If a VM has no place to go after the node affinities are deduced, it is considered non-live-migratable

Besides detecting the live-migratability of the VMs on the node, the tool can also shut down the VMs that are not live-migratable if the `--shutdown` flag is given.

### Usage

```
$ vm-live-migrate-detector --help
A simple VM detector and executor for Harvester upgrades

The detector accepts a node name and inferences the possible places the VMs on top of it could be live migrated to.
If there is no place to go, it can optionally shut down the VMs.

Usage:
  vm-live-migrate-detector NODENAME [flags]

Flags:
      --debug                set logging level to debug
  -h, --help                 help for vm-live-migrate-detector
      --kubeconfig string    Path to the kubeconfig file (default "/home/rancher/.kube/config")
      --kubecontext string   Context name
      --shutdown             Shutdown non-migratable VMs
      --trace                set logging level to trace
  -v, --version              version for vm-live-migrate-detector
```

Given a node name, it can iterate all the VMs that are running on top of the node, and return with a list of non-live-migratable VMs.

```
$ export KUBECONFIG=/tmp/kubeconfig

$ vm-live-migrate-detector harvester-z5hd8
INFO[0000] Starting VM Live Migrate Detector
INFO[0000] Checking vms on node harvester-z5hd8...
INFO[0000] default/test-vm
INFO[0000] Non-migratable VM(s): [default/test-vm]
```

It can help you shut down those non-live-migratable VMs if you have the `--shutdown` flag specified.

```
$ vm-live-migrate-detector harvester-z5hd8 --shutdown
INFO[0000] Starting VM Live Migrate Detector
INFO[0000] Checking vms on node harvester-z5hd8...
INFO[0000] default/test-vm
INFO[0000] Non-migratable VM(s): [default/test-vm]
INFO[0000] vm default/test-vm was administratively stopped
