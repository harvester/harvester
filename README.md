[![Build Status](https://drone-publish.rancher.io/api/badges/rancher/harvester/status.svg)](https://drone-publish.rancher.io/rancher/harvester)

Rancher Harvester is an open source Hyper-Converged Infrastructure(HCI) solution based on Kubernetes.

## Mode

Harvester supports two modes:

### Bare-metal [IN-DEVELOPMENT]

In the `Bare-metal` mode, user can install Harvester using ISO directly on bare-metal nodes to form a Harvester cluster.

### App

In the `App` mode, user can deploy Harvester using Helm to an existing Kubernetes cluster.

Note: Hardware-assisted virtualization must be supported on the Kubernetes nodes.

##### Install as an App
Harvester can be installed on a Kubernetes cluster in the following ways:
- Rancher catalog app (**Preferred method for install**) 
    - You can add this repo to the Rancher Catalog as a Helm v3 App
- [Helm](https://github.com/rancher/harvester/tree/master/deploy/charts/harvester) (**Does not handle Harvester UI**) 

## Documentation
Please refer to the [docs](./docs) to find out more details.
