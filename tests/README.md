## Harvester Testing

This path contains the basic testing framework and integration testing cases, the primary focus in here to covering all Harvester APIs with integration testing cases.

### Integration test
The integration test is performed on every pull request and is run by the Drone CI. The script is stored in the `scripts/test-integration` file.

## How to run
  * Configure appropriate environment variables
    - set `KUBECONFIG` path and configure `export USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER=true` to use an existing cluster, default to create a local `Kind` cluster.
        - For the local `Kind` cluster, you can specify `export KIND_IMAGE_MIRROR="http://your-mirror-address:port" ` to speed up pulling images.
    - configure `export SKIP_HARVESTER_INSTALLATION=true` to skip Harvester installation, default to install a new harvester chart or update the existing one.
    - set `export DONT_USE_EMULATION=true` if the harvester runtime supports KVM, default to using `QEMU` software emulation.
    - set `export KEEP_TESTING_CLUSTER=true` if you want to keep the testing cluster, default to delete the local `Kind` cluster.
    - set `export KEEP_HARVESTER_INSTALLATION=true` if you want to keep the harvester installation, default to delete it on exit, this will always be true when `SKIP_HARVESTER_INSTALLATION=true`.
    - set `export KEEP_TESTING_RESOURCE=true` if we want to keep testing resources, default to delete each testing resource after each test case finished.
    - set `export ENABLE_E2E_TESTS=true` if want to run e2e test, the user must have an existing Kubernetes cluster.

* Run `./scripts/test-integration` or `make test-integration`.
    - if you want to use an existing cluster with a pre-installed harvester chart, make sure to config the replicas of `harvester` deployment to be `0`, then run `$ env USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER=true SKIP_HARVESTER_INSTALLATION=true ./scripts/test-integration`.
