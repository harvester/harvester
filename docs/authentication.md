## Developer Mode
In `developer mode`, which is intended only for development and testing purposes, more authentication modes are configurable using the environment variable `HARVESTER_AUTHENTICATION_MODE`.

Harvester Dashboard default to use `local auth` mode for authentication. The default username and password is `admin/password`.

The currently supported options are `localUser` (the same as `local auth` mode) and `kubernetesCredentials`.

If the `kubernetesCredentials` authentication option is used, either a `kubeconfig` file or bearer token can provide access to Harvester.
