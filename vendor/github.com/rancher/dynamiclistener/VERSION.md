DynamicListener follows a pre-release (v0.x) strategy of semver. There is limited compatibility between releases, though we do aim to avoid breaking changes on minor version lines. DynamicListener aims to support a limited set of Kubernetes minor versions (all values below are inclusive in start and end). The current supported versions of DynamicListener are as follows:

The current supported release lines are:

| DynamicListener Branch | DynamicListener Minor version | Kubernetes Version Range |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| main | v0.6 | v1.27+ |
| release/v0.5 | v0.5 | v1.26 - v1.30 |
| release/v0.4 | v0.4 | v1.25 - v1.28 |
