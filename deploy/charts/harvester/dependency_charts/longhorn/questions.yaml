For example, 10 means 10% of the total CPU on a node will be allocated to each engine manager pod on this node. This will help maintain engine stability during high node workload.
    In order to prevent unexpected volume engine crash as well as guarantee a relative acceptable IO performance, you can use the following formula to calculate a value for this setting:
    Guaranteed Engine Manager CPU = The estimated max Longhorn volume engine count on a node * 0.1 / The total allocatable CPUs on the node * 100.
    The result of above calculation doesn't mean that's the maximum CPU resources the Longhorn workloads require. To fully exploit the Longhorn volume I/O performance, you can allocate/guarantee more CPU resources via this setting.
    If it's hard to estimate the usage now, you can leave it with the default value, which is 12%. Then you can tune it when there is no running workload using Longhorn volumes.
    WARNING:
      - Value 0 means unsetting CPU requests for engine manager pods.
      - Considering the possible new instance manager pods in the further system upgrade, this integer value is range from 0 to 40. And the sum with setting 'Guaranteed Engine Manager CPU' should not be greater than 40.
      - One more set of instance manager pods may need to be deployed when the Longhorn system is upgraded. If current available CPUs of the nodes are not enough for the new instance manager pods, you need to detach the volumes using the oldest instance manager pods so that Longhorn can clean up the old pods automatically and release the CPU resources. And the new pods with the latest instance manager image will be launched then.
      - This global setting will be ignored for a node if the field \"EngineManagerCPURequest\" on the node is set.
      - After this setting is changed, all engine manager pods using this global setting on all the nodes will be automatically restarted. In other words, DO NOT CHANGE THIS SETTING WITH ATTACHED VOLUMES."

    The result of above calculation doesn't mean that's the maximum CPU resources the Longhorn workloads require. To fully exploit the Longhorn volume I/O performance, you can allocate/guarantee more CPU resources via this setting.
    If it's hard to estimate the usage now, you can leave it with the default value, which is 12%. Then you can tune it when there is no running workload using Longhorn volumes.
    WARNING:
      - Value 0 means unsetting CPU requests for replica manager pods.
      - Considering the possible new instance manager pods in the further system upgrade, this integer value is range from 0 to 40. And the sum with setting 'Guaranteed Replica Manager CPU' should not be greater than 40.
      - One more set of instance manager pods may need to be deployed when the Longhorn system is upgraded. If current available CPUs of the nodes are not enough for the new instance manager pods, you need to detach the volumes using the oldest instance manager pods so that Longhorn can clean up the old pods automatically and release the CPU resources. And the new pods with the latest instance manager image will be launched then.
      - This global setting will be ignored for a node if the field \"ReplicaManagerCPURequest\" on the node is set.
      - After this setting is changed, all replica manager pods using this global setting on all the nodes will be automatically restarted. In other words, DO NOT CHANGE THIS SETTING WITH ATTACHED VOLUMES."
