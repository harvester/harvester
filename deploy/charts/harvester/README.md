# Harvester Helm Chart

## Chart Details

- Deploy the Harvester resources.
- Deploy [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io) as the built-in storage management.
- Deploy Containerized Data Importer (CDI) to support third-party storage management.
- Deploy csi-snapshotter
- Deploy Snapshot Validation Webhook
- Deploy whereabouts

## Introduction

Harvester uses a `ManagedChart` resource to deploy its core components. This is configured via the [harvester-installer](https://github.com/harvester/harvester-installer/blob/master/pkg/config/templates/rancherd-10-harvester.yaml). Be aware that `deploy/harvester` and `deploy/harvester-crd` are two separate `ManagedChart` resources.

Once a `ManagedChart` is created, Fleet generates a `Bundle` resource to trigger Helm and install the chart. You can learn more about this process in the [Fleet documentation](https://fleet.rancher.io/concepts).

During upgrades, Harvester runs a script to patch the release version in the `ManagedChart`. This happens in the [`upgrade_manifests.sh`](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/blob/50da36ac3b751c1a1dbfc8d25e5499a4c6216450/package/upgrade/upgrade_manifests.sh#L885-L935) script.


## For Developers

### How to bump dependency charts

1. Make sure the correct dependency version is specified in `go.mod`.
2. Run `go mod vendor`.
3. Update the `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml` files with the correct version numbers.
4. In the `deploy/charts/harvester` directory, run `helm dependency update .`
   
If the dependency doesnâ€™t involve a change in go.mod, you can start from step 3.

Here are example PRs for reference:

- https://github.com/harvester/harvester/pull/8233
- https://github.com/harvester/harvester/pull/8210

### Use case

To use Longhorn release candidates for testing purposes, download the Longhorn charts and place them in `deploy/charts/harvester/dependency_charts/longhorn`.

Since we're using a non-official version, we need to modify the Chart.yaml to point to the local folder instead of the remote repository:

```diff
-  repository: https://charts.longhorn.io
-  version: 1.7.1
+  repository: file://dependency_charts/longhorn
+  version: 1.7.2-rc2
```
